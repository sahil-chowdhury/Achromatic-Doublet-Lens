# Design and Ray Tracing Analysis of an Achromatic Doublet Lens

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the design and ray tracing 
analysis of an achromatic doublet lens using Python.

## Project Description
A Python program was developed to design an achromatic doublet. The code distributes power between crown and flint
lenses using their Abbe numbers to cancel chromatic aberration. Lens curvatures are then computed from the thick
lensmaker’s formula and scaled to match the target focal length. Finally, paraxial ray tracing is performed for different
wavelengths to verify the achromatic condition, and the program outputs the final curvatures, thicknesses, and focal
lengths.
